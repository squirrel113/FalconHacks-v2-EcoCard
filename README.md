# Eco-Card | FalconHacks v2
Welcome to EcoCard, a revolutionary app for sustainable living. With this application you can: Scan your receipts Discover eco-friendly products Earn SOL (DIGITAL CURRENCY â†’ may redeem for products!)

## Inspiration
Our inspiration behind EcoCard was the urgent need to promote sustainable living practices in our society. I aimed to create an innovative solution that not only encourages people to adopt eco-friendly products but also:
- rewards them for their environmentally conscious choices 
- make a significant positive impact on our planet

## What it does
EcoCard is a powerful tool that empowers users to make eco-conscious choices effortlessly. Users can identify and track the eco-friendly products they purchase by scanning their receipts. The app provides valuable information about these products and allows users to earn SOL, our digital currency, for every eco-friendly purchase. These SOL points can be redeemed for various sustainable products, creating a cycle of awareness, action, and reward that motivates users to continue making environmentally friendly choices.

## How to use EcoCard
1. Scan your receipt through OpenCV (Computer Vision)
2. Application analyzes items through OpenAI API Integration
3. SOL Account Creation/Automated Transfer of Cryptocurrency through Blockchain Tech.
3a. Earn SOL for eco-friendly items
3b. Deduct SOL for non-environmental choices

## How I built it
I developed EcoCard's backend using Python and Solana's blockchain technology. By importing essential Solana modules, establishing a connection to the Solana Mainnet API, and generating secure user accounts, I enabled users to engage in sustainable transactions. The system dynamically created new Solana accounts for users, ensuring a balance of at least 1 SOL to facilitate eco-friendly transactions, and providing real-time feedback on account details.

For EcoCard's frontend functionality, I employed Express.js, a powerful Node.js framework, to create a responsive web application. Through Express, I established RESTful API endpoints for user management and receipt scanning, enabling seamless communication with the backend. I integrated MongoDB with Mongoose for structured data storage and utilized Multer for efficient file uploads, allowing users to submit receipt images. Additionally, I harnessed OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model for real-time eco-friendly scoring of scanned items, providing users with instant feedback on their sustainable choices.

## Challenges I ran into
During the development of EcoCard, I encountered several challenges. One of the major hurdles was ensuring the accuracy of product recognition from diverse and sometimes complex receipts. Overcoming this challenge required fine-tuning our algorithms and extensive testing to enhance the app's reliability. Additionally, integrating a secure and efficient digital currency system posed another set of challenges, which our team successfully addressed through meticulous coding and rigorous security protocols

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am incredibly proud of creating a user-friendly, reliable, and innovative platform that promotes sustainable living. One of our significant accomplishments is achieving a high level of accuracy in product recognition, enabling users to trust the app's recommendations. I am happy to establish a robust and secure digital currency system that seamlessly integrates with the app is a testament to our team's dedication and expertise.

## What I learned
Throughout the development of EcoCard, our team learned the importance of collaboration, innovation, and perseverance. I gained valuable insights into the complexities of sustainable product recognition and the intricacies of digital currency systems. Furthermore, I deepened our understanding of user behavior, enabling us to create an intuitive interface that encourages active user engagement.

## What's next for EcoCard | Transforming Recipts --> Transforming Future 
Looking ahead, we have ambitious plans to expand EcoCard's impact on sustainable living. We aim to continuously refine our product recognition algorithms, ensuring they encompass a wider range of products and receipt formats. We also plan to collaborate with more eco-friendly brands, enriching our product database and offering users an even broader selection of sustainable options. We are exploring partnerships with environmental organizations and local communities to raise awareness about eco-conscious living. By organizing events, workshops, and educational initiatives, we intend to create a community that actively participates in shaping a greener future. 

Additionally, we are working on integrating features that enable users to share their eco-friendly achievements with their social networks, fostering a sense of community and encouraging others to join the movement.EcoCard is not just an app; it's a catalyst for positive change.
